# A Simple Chatbot Application

This is a simple chatbot made using React. This was inspired from Kim Nguyen's article on making a simple chatbot demo based on her virtual assistant Stewy used in Hipstew.

The styles for the components are inside the components/styles folder. The sass contains the sass files for the styles if you wanna have a look.
